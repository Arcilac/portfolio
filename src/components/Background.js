            Discovered my passion for programming at 17 during high school, leading me down an
            unconventional path as a self-taught developer. Eschewing traditional university
            engineering programs, I embraced rigorous self-study, online courses, and hands-on
            projects to master programming languages and frameworks. This self-directed journey
            demonstrates my dedication, adaptability, and commitment to achieving excellence in the
            tech industry, underlining my ability to thrive in dynamic environments and solve
            complex problems with innovative solutions.
